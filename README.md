# 🏠Laxius Decor
#### **Smart Home & Ceremony Decoration Booking System**

## Project Overview

**Laxius Decor** is a modern appointment management system for a local decoration business. Users can explore decoration services, check decorator availability, select dates & times, make payments and track service status in real-time.

The system solves common issues faced by local decorators:
- Long waiting times for consultations
- No online booking system
- Difficulty managing multiple decorators and their specialties
- No system for on-site service coordination
